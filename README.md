## Approch to project step-by-step

- read through the requirements
- used bootstrap cdn to import required css and js for bootstrap
- structured project into root, pages, and assets
- wrote basic html without bootstrap usage
- used ai to recommend bootstrap classes for proper alignment

## challenges
challenges involved
- footer not at the bottom
  - fixed by wrapping content into main except footer and using 90vh css
- i have been familiar with bootstrap in the past but i felt a litle rusty, so took help of ai
- copy-pasting involved for navbar and footer across html pages since they are the same
  - templating will help here

## time taken
- building: 20 min
- hosting: 5 min

## how did it help me
- i revisited plain file based html routing and writing bootstrap again
